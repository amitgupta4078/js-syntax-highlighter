The parser functionality mainly depends on strings and quotes. The set of characters (which may contain normal char arrays, keywords, white spaces and special characters) may or may not appear in between quotes.

if quotes:
	if quotes not started:
		start the quotes
		add green quotes
	if quotes already started:
		end quotes
		if collecting strings:
			add green collected string
		add green closing quotes
if not quotes:
	if alphabetical character:
		if already storing string:
			store the letter
		if not storing string already:
			start storing the string
			store the letter
	if not alphabetical character:
		if quotes are started:
			if strings are being stored:
				add green stored string
			add green current letter
		if quotes are not started:
			if strings are being stored:
				add normal stored string
			add the character with appropriate class

All characters in the input string have been parsed now. If the end character was alphabetical, it means we were storing it and now we need to attach that stored string.

If storing string already:
	if quotes started already:
		add green stored string
	if not started quotes already:
		add black stored string
